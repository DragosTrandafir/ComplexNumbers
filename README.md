Using C++ classes to perform complex number operations and displaying Mandelbrot sequence.

The Project18 directory contains the header, the implementation and the main file , which shows how a complex number class can be
created and used. Also, the main file shows the Mandelbrot sequence representation of comnplex numbers, which is quite interesting to
observe.
MORE DETAILS are provided in the documentation available in the files.

The problem 2 directory is a more basic implementation of a bank account class, which helps the begginers to learn and observe the important aspects
of the classes in C++, by providing constructor, distructor, operators and giving examples of a few operations which can
be performed.

You can run this project by simply downloading the problem 2 and Project18 directories and running them (main.cpp file) in a C++ IDE, preferably C Lion or VS Community.
